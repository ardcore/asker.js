asker asks questions in the console, grabs responses and returns them as object.
it can be used for various generators/makefiles etc.

questions should be passed as array of object, each described using the following format:

`{ topic: 'sex', question: 'What is your sex?', options: ['male', 'female'], default: 'male', mandatory: true }`

where `topic` will become key of the returned object, `question` is merely question displayed, `options` - if present - narrow the possible answer to one of them. `default` and `mandatory` are probably obvious.

bare minimum: `{ topic: 'hello', question: 'how are you?' }`
 
after all questions are answered, callback function is invoked.
example:

`asker.ask(questionArray, function(err, data) {
	if (err) throw err;
	console.log(data);
})`
